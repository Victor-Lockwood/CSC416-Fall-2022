; Problem:
; Define a function to compute the distance between
; two points which is consistent with the following specifications:
;   - The name of the function will be distance.
;   - It will receive four parameters, called x1 and y1 (which collectively constitute point 1)
;     and x2 and y2 (which collectively constitute point 2) â€“ in that order, from left to right.
;   - The function returns the distance between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
;
